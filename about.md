## About the **Open Health Information Mediator** (OpenHIM)

The OpenHIM is an interoperability layer: a software component that enables easier interoperability between disparate electronic information systems by providing a central point where the exchange of data is managed.

An interoperability layer receives transactions from different information systems and coordinates the interactions between them. The OpenHIM provides a layer of abstraction between systems that allows for the transformation of incoming messages to a form that the other system components expect and can support the business logic by orchestrating the transaction flow.

// TODO: Add an image or an example here to clarify?

Some examples of common workflows that the OpenHIM can support to facilitate the sharing of health information within a Health Information Exchange are:

- Save a patient's clinical encounter to a shared health record so that authorized healthcare providers are able to access key clinical data that can inform better care
- Retrieve relevant information about patient encounters and care plans for authorized healthcare providers
- Receive aggregate reporting information from a client system and send this to an aggregate data store
- Manage health facilities
- Manage patient demographics and identity to allow for the tracking of a patient’s activity within and between healthcare organizations and across the continuum of care

### Project History

The OpenHIM was initially developed by Jembi Health Systems in collaboration with the Health Architecture Laboratory ( HeAL) at the University of KwaZulu-Natal as part of the Rwanda Health Enterprise Architecture (RHEA) project, and formed the basis for Ryan Crichton’s Master's thesis “The Open Health Information Mediator: an Architecture for Enabling Interoperability in Low to Middle Income Countries”. The OpenHIM is the current reference technology for the interoperability layer of the OpenHIE (Open Health Information Exchange). It is supported through a number of implementation projects that drive its continuing development to meet real world needs.
