### Tasks resource

Tasks are used to submit transactions to be re-run.

`https://<server>:<api_port>/tasks`

#### Fetch all tasks

`GET /tasks`

The response status code will be `200` if successful and the response body will contain an array of task objects. See the [tasks schema](https://github.com/jembi/openhim-core-js/blob/master/src/model/tasks.js).

#### Add a task

`POST /tasks`

with a json body representing the task to be added in the following format:

```json
{
  "tids": [
    "id#1",
    "id#2",
    ...
    "id#N"
  ],
  "batchSize": 4,   //optional
  "paused": true    //optional
}
```

The `tids` field should contain an array of transaction identifiers indicating the transactions that need to be rerun. The `batchSize` field indicates the number of transactions that the core should run concurrently. To prevent a task from immediately starting upon add, the `paused` field can be added. In this case the task will simply be scheduled with a `Paused` status, ready to be started at any later stage.

The response code will be `201` if successful.

#### Fetch a specific task

`GET /tasks/:taskId`

where `:taskId` is the `_id` property of the task to fetch.

The response status code will be `200` if successful and the response body will contain a task object. See the [task schema](https://github.com/jembi/openhim-core-js/blob/master/src/model/tasks.js).

#### Update a task

`PUT /tasks/:taskId`

where `:taskId` is the `_id` property of the task to update.

Tasks can be paused, resumed or cancelled by sending through an update with status equal to `Paused`, `Queued` or `Cancelled` respectively.

The response code will be `200` if successful.

#### Delete a task

`DELETE /tasks/:taskId`

where `:taskId` is the `_id` property of the task to delete.

The response code will be `200` if successful.
