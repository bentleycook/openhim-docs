The OpenHIM serves as a reference technology for the Interoperability Layer in the [OpenHIE architecture](https://ohie.org/), and we welcome involvement in the [Interoperability Layer community](https://wiki.ohie.org/display/SUB/Interoperability+Layer+Community) for those looking to participate in discussions and knowledge sharing around the architecture, use of standards and specifications of the Interoperability Layer and the OpenHIM. We hold a monthly call for the Interoperability Layer every third Tuesday of the month (excluding holidays) from 4:00 - 5:00 PM GMT+2. For more information, please visit the [community call agendas page](https://wiki.ohie.org/display/resources/Interoperability+Layer+Subcommunity+Calls).

We use [OpenHIE Discourse](https://discourse.ohie.org/) as our preferred communications and support platform for the OpenHIM. We subscribe to and are bound by the OpenHIE Community Guidelines (<https://discourse.ohie.org/faq>). If you have a question about the OpenHIM or would like to get involved, please join the conversation on Discourse using the **[#openhim](https://discourse.ohie.org/tag/openhim)** tag. We also frequently check the **[#interoperability-layer](https://discourse.ohie.org/tag/interoperability-layer)** and **[#technical-assistance](https://discourse.ohie.org/tag/technical-assistance)** tags.

For developers looking to log bugs and/or feature requests, you can also add an issue on [Github](https://github.com/jembi/openhim-core-js), or submit pull requests for changes that you'd like to see.

For additional support, resources and ways to get involved, please see the [OpenHIM Help page](http://openhim.org/help/).
