Allows for the management of OpenHIM audits.

The OpenHIM will generate audit events on application start/stop, as well as user authentication. These events can either be sent to the OpenHIMâ€™s own internal audit repository, or to an external repository.

## ATNA Audit

The OpenHIM provides full support as an Audit Repository actor in the IHE [ATNA](https://wiki.ihe.net/index.php/Audit_Trail_and_Node_Authentication) profile.
